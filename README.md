The [three-body problem]([https://www.google.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) comes from physics and mathematics, specifically (dynamical systems)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system].

[Double pendulums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum) are an easy way of demonstrating the (three-body problem)[[https://www.google.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem].

In a nutshell:

- A pendulum is 100% [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system). It's behavior and where it will be in the future are 100% predictable once you know certain facts about it.
- A double-pendulum (which is nothing but adding another pendulum to the first one) on the other hand, behaves [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). Mind you, it's still deterministic. But long-term predictions where the second pendulum will be in the (far) future are now almost impossible.
